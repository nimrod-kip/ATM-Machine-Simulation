# 🏧 ATM Machine Simulator

A simple and interactive ATM Machine Simulator built with JavaScript that mimics the core functionalities of a real-world ATM. This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as user authentication, transaction handling, input validation, and UI interaction.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication** (PIN verification)  
- **Check Balance**  
  **Withdraw Funds** (with validation)  
- **Deposit Funds**  
- **Transaction History**  
- **Logout/Exit**

---

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS** – for user interface  
- **JavaScript** – core logic and interactivity

---

##  Demo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-machine-simulator.git
   cd atm-machine-simulator
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. **Use the simulator**
   - Enter your PIN to log in.
   - Choose actions from the menu: check balance, deposit, withdraw, or view transaction history.
